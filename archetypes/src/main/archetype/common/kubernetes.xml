## Deploy the application to Kubernetes

```
kubectl cluster-info                        # Verify which cluster
kubectl get pods                            # Verify connectivity to cluster
kubectl create -f app.yaml                  # Deploy application
kubectl get pods                            # Wait for quickstart pod to be RUNNING
kubectl get service {{artifactId}}          # Get service info
```

Note the PORTs. You can now exercise the application as you did before but use the second
port number (the NodePort) instead of 8080.

After youâ€™re done, cleanup.

```
kubectl delete -f app.yaml
```
